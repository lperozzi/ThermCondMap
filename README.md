# ThermCondMap

ThermCondMap is a web-based application aimed to investigate the thermal conductivity in a region of the great Montr√©al. It is built using [cartodb.js](https://github.com/CartoDB/cartodb.js).

It is composed of:

- Geological layers:
    - Detailed geology
    - The surficial geology
    - Thickness of surficial deposits
    - Thermostratigraphic units


- Measured data
    - wells
    - outcrop
    - synthetic data


- Simulated thermal conductivity (at bedrock level)
    - One random realization
    - Mean of realization
    - Variance
